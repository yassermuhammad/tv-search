It starred several former members of the ABC series The D-Generation such as Magda Szubanski, Marg Downey, Michael Veitch as well as other Melbourne-based comedians such as The Eleventh Hour's Steve Vizard and Peter Moon, and Jane Turner and Gina Riley who are now famous for Kath &amp; Kim. It also marked the first time that Kath &amp; Kim stars Turner, Riley and Szubanski worked together on screen. All episodes were directed by Ted Emery. \u003Ci\u003EFast Forward\u003C/i\u003E was formatted to simulate continuous channel surfing, and after the punchline, each sketch would abruptly switch to a momentary segment of static, followed by another sketch, simulating the effect of the viewer repeatedly switching channels. It featured many spoofs of television programs of the day, politicians...\u003C/p\u003E",
